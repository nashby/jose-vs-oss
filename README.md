He's José Valim. He does a lot of open source. So let's help him to fight Gihub issues.

It's Google Chrome extension that adds 4 additional buttons to help [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim) manage open source projects on Github.

  * **Sample app** button - post comment with the following text: 'Can you please provide a sample application that reproduces the error?'
  * **Wiki** button - close an issue with the following text: 'The wiki is maintained by the community. So if there aren't any up to date instructions, we recommend you to explore the solution yourself and hopefully contribute your findings back!'
  * **Mailing list** button - close an issue with the following comment: 'Please use the mailing list or StackOverflow for questions'
  * **Bad bug report** button - close an issue with the following comment: 'You need to give us more information on how to reproduce this issue, otherwise there is nothing we can do. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information about creating bug reports. Thanks!'
